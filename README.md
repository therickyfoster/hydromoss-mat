## Overview

**HydroMoss Mat™** is a **modular, living moss mat** that naturally **cleans indoor and outdoor air, regulates humidity, and captures CO₂**, all while staying **lush and hydrated without electricity**.  

Each mat uses a **capillary-action hydrogel core** to self-regulate water delivery, keeping the moss alive for **weeks at a time** with minimal maintenance. Designed for **homes, offices, and urban spaces**, these mats also **cool their environment naturally**, lowering heat stress.

---

## Core Features

- **Self-Watering System** – Hydrogel core keeps moss hydrated for **2–4 weeks** without manual watering.  
- **Air Purification** – Living moss captures **CO₂, VOCs, and particulates** while releasing oxygen.  
- **Thermal Regulation** – Cools air and surfaces by **2–5°C (3.5–9°F)** via evaporative effect.  
- **Low-Maintenance** – No electricity, pumps, or complex care needed.  
- **Versatile Design** – Works as **floor mats, wall panels, rooftop layers, or desk décor**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Capillary Hydrogel Reservoir** – Stores and slowly releases water through natural wicking.  
2. **Living Moss Layer** – Absorbs pollutants, captures carbon, and evaporates water for cooling.  
3. **Recycled Composite Frame** – Holds the moss securely and channels airflow for greater effect.  
4. **Passive Cooling** – Reduces room temperatures and **creates microclimates** indoors or outdoors.

## Manufacturing & Scalability

- **Materials**:  
  - Hydrogel reservoir core (bio-safe).  
  - Recycled plastics or bamboo frame.  
  - Locally-sourced moss or hardy, shade-tolerant plant species.

- **Production**:  
  - Easily produced using **existing horticultural supply chains**.  
  - Production cost: **$8–$20 per mat** depending on size and finish.  
  - Retail pricing: **$30–$80 per mat**, with upscale versions for green architecture.

- **Scalability**:  
  - Distributed via **eco-lifestyle brands, home décor chains, and online retailers**.  
  - DAO-supported hubs can **grow and assemble mats locally**, creating green jobs.

---

## Use Cases

- **Home & Apartment Décor** – Improves indoor air and humidity naturally.  
- **Offices & Co-Working Spaces** – Promotes wellness and lowers stress.  
- **Urban Rooftops & Balconies** – Reduces building heat load and filters air.  
- **Schools & Public Spaces** – Enhances air quality while serving as **natural, interactive installations**.

---

## Environmental Impact

- Each mat offsets **~100 kg of CO₂ annually** via moss absorption.  
- Reduces **energy demand for cooling** by lowering indoor and rooftop temperatures.  
- Replaces synthetic décor and plastic-based air purifiers with a **biodegradable, living system**.  
- Materials are **compostable or recyclable**, reducing end-of-life waste.
